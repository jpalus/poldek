0.42.2 (bugfix release; 2020/04/09)

     • cli: avoid loading installed packages with desc --log/-L

     • solver: proper handling of redundant requirements

     • solver: improved package scoring (fixes
       https://bugs.launchpad.net/poldek/+bug/1722104)

     • cli: optimized rpmdb cache loading (avoid double creation of directory
       index)

0.42.1 (bugfix release; 2020/03/16)

     • unified '--clean' and '-n repo --clean' behavior. All --clean
       subvariants: --clean-pkg, --clean-whole/--cleana are obsoleted now.

     • Fixed package deduplication with "unique package names = y" (#4)

     • Fixed download progress bar on non-tty outputs (#2)

     • multilib: back to comparing package architecture scores provided by
       rpmPlatformScore()

     • Fixed config macros expanding (#3)

     • multilib: fixed architecture flip-flop in transaction summary (#1)

0.42.0 (performance; 2020/03/02)

     • cli: faster shell boot time due to lazy load repos; compacted and
       colored install/ uninstall summary and downloading progress bar

     • feat: use XDG_CACHE_HOME/poldek as default cache directory

     • performance: faster (about 40%) repo loading: optimized capabilities
       indexes, zero backward fseeks (which is slow with compressed files),
       mtime based verification cache and lazy deps processing

     • depsolver: with "upgrade multiple instances" config option, poldek
       handle upgrades of multiple installed packages: most recent version is
       upgraded while other installed versions are kept untouch

     • ZSTD support: create zst repos with --mo=zst or with "compr = zst"
       source config option (or with global "default index compr = zst").
       ZSTD is faster than GZIP, saves about 200ms on PLD TH repo loading
       (~30K packages).

     • SSL SNI support

     • fix: allow multiple --rpmdef command line options

     • fix: minor memleaks fixed

0.40.0 (rpm.org; 2019/12/31)

     • rpm.org support (except boolean dependencies yet; beta)

     • internal HTTPS support

     • depsolver: score orphan successors to select best fit

     • performance: faster package repo loading (avoiding backward fseeks)

     • cleanup: removed support for obsoleted package repo formats: pdir
       (poldek <= 0.18), hdrl (old apt) and old yum

     • openssl >= 1.1.1 support (openssl.patch) Arkadiusz Miskiewicz

     • fix: allow to transfer file via FTP even if server does not report
       file mtime (poldek-notzdata.patch) Arkadiusz Miskiewicz

     • fixed incorrect WTERMSIG usage (WTERMSIG.patch) Jan Rękorajski

0.20 (major enhancements release; 2005/10/28)

   This release introduces new series of poldek. Significant changes and
   differences from 0.18.x series

  Package repositories

     • repositories code has been redesigned and totally rewritten in the
       modular, plugin-like way, so is is quite easy to add support for new
       formats.

     • new 'pndir' is the default format now. It is based on tndb (cdb like)
       DBM library. To save bandwidth package descriptions (Description,
       Summary, etc) are stored in 2 separate files: first named
       packages.ndir.dscr with common (BuildHost, Distribution, etc) and "C"
       descriptions and second with all non-C descriptions).

     • 'hdrl' aka 'apt' format are update-able

     • support for Yum and Metadata XML repositories

     • repository indexes could be created in many formats at once using --mt
       switch, ex:

     $ poldek -s /foo/bar --mkdix --mt=pdir,pndir


     • indexes may be created from any index format, i.e conversion to to
       another format is supported, ex:

     $ poldek --st apt -s /foo/bar --mkidx=/ala/ma --mt=pdir


     • (re)creation of native poldek's indexes (pdir, pndir) is much faster
       now package headers are not loaded at all if package's file
       modification time is the same as saved one in existing index.

  Installation related

     • uninstallation code has been rewritten and improved. Packages are
       removed with its reverse dependencies and in the right order,
       according to {pre,post}un requirements

     • poldek can perform 'to repository' installation, i.e packages are
       copied from source to destination repository with full dependency
       checking, ex:

     $ poldek -n ...  --dt pdir --destination /foo/bar/RPMS --upgrade-dist -v
     $ poldek -n ...  --dn name --upgrade-dist -v


  Interactive mode

     • interactive mode commands are available directly from command line

    $ poldek --cmd ls foo
    $ ipoldek ls foo


     • command aliases are defined in external configuration file (Mariusz
       Mazur <mmazur a kernel pl>)

     • commands may be piped, ex:

      poldek> rsearch /poldek/ | ls -l


     • external commands are supported:

      poldek> rsearch /pol/ | !grep ^pol


  Configuration

     • multi word option names may be written with spaces or underscore
       separator, i.e: both forms "this is = foo" and "this_is = foo" are
       valid.

     • default location of configuration file has been changed to
       "${_sysconfdir}/poldek/poldek.conf", old /etc location is still
       supported.

     • configuration file format has been changed to ini-like one. Sources
       and external file getters should be configured in its own sections
       "source" and "fetcher", see sample configs. Old configuration format
       is still supported.

     • environment variables in config files are expanded, for example:

    cachedir = $HOME/.cache


     • support for simple macros has been added to make configuration easier
       to write and read, for example:

    _arch   = i686
    _prefix = ftp://ftp.pld.org.pl/dists

    [source]
    type  = pdir
    name  = pld-ra
    path  = %{_prefix}/ra/PLD/%{_arch}/PLD/RPMS/

    [source]
    type  = pdir
    name  = pld-ra-updates
    path  = %{_prefix}/ra/updates/general/%{_arch}/


     • %include directive has been added, it can include both local and
       remote files:

    %include source.conf
    %include ftp://ftp.pld.org.pl/dists/ra/source.conf


       Remote files once downloaded are stored in cache directory. To
       resynchronize them with it's remote copy use --upconf option.

     • support for APT sources configuration has been added - new "load apt
       sources list" configuration option.

  General

     • some command line switches has been changed, but all obsoleted
       switches are still supported *except* "-f" (not important IMO).
       Changes:

       0.18.x                     0.20
     ------------------------------------
    -f, --fast               => --skip-installed
    --mkidxz                 => --mkidx           (compression is on by default)
    --sidx, --sdir, --shdrl  =>                   (use --st=TYPE -s instead)
    --unique-pkg-names       => --uniq
    --shcmd                  =>                   (use --cmd or run ipoldek)


     • configuration options may be set from command line by -O switch, for
       example:

     $ poldek -Ovfile_external_compress=yes


     • PLD-FreeBSD port

       processing)

     • vfile's progress bar improvements (Patryk Zawadzki <patrys att
       pld-linux org>)

     • fix: disabled package Epoch's autopromotion while checking if it

       supported

     • killed SIGSEGVs on 64bit architecture (Jakub Bogusz <qboosh att
       pld-linux org>)

     • fixed Epoch comparison bug while checking uninstalled capabilities

     • vfile: progress bar shows remaining time and transfer rate (Patryk

       net>)

     • fixed serious bug of checking unversioned dependencies

     • --ignore{arch,os} rpm options are honored

     • rpm options could be passed as --rpm=OPTION too, i.e. --rpm=ignorearch

     • new cmdline options --rpm-{force,nodeps} which are passed as --force
       and --nodeps to /bin/rpm only.

     • more aggressive package upgrades - orphaned packages are upgraded
       instead of processing its dependencies. This behavior is enabled by
       "greedy" option. To disable put "aggressive_greedy = no" to config.

     • "greedy" upgrade mode is enabled by default

     • conflicts with already installed packages are treated as resolved if
       at least one of multiple-installed package satisfies conflict. Of
       course RPM doesn't support such cases, so additionally --rpm-nodepsis
       needed (use with care). This behavior is enabled by default, put
       "allow_duplicates=no" to config to disable it.

     • displaying package size summary of installed package set

     • --unique-pkg-names (-Q) behavior is more intuitive now - highest
       version of package are taken instead of one from highest
       prioritizedsource

     • do not die if rpmdb iterator returns NULL (possibly broken rpm
       database) (Arkadiusz Miskiewicz <arekm att pld-linux org>)

     • vfile_external_compress=yes in config allows gzipped indexes to be
       used on systems with broken zlib linked in rpmio library(rpm 4.2 from
       RedHat 9, Fedora)

     • kill unaligned traps on Alpha, time_t is not 32bit long (Jakub Bogusz
       <qboosh att pld-linux org>) (Jakub Bogusz <qboosh att pld-linux org>)

     • new "promoteepoch" config and cmdline option switches Epoch to
       comparision compatible with rpm prior to 4.2.1 (with help of Jakub
       Bogusz <qboosh att pld-linux org>)

     • support for RPM 4.2/4.3

       org>)

     • few dependency processing improvements

     • 'hold' and 'ignore' package masks are matched with source name,
       package epoch, version and release, i.e. masks apache-1.3.2* or
       ra:apache-1* are valid ones now.

     • new: with --unique-pkg-names (-Q) packages with the same name are
       removed from available package set

     • sources are prioritized in order they are passed in cmdline, i.e. with
       $ poldek -s /foo/bar -n pld, source 'foo/bar' obtains highest priority
       than 'pld', no matter what priority 'pld' has in config file.

     • fixed available package list management in interactive mode

     • AM/AC stuff cleanup and adaptation to their new versions (automake 1.7
       and autoconf 2.54) (Artur Frysiak <wiget att pld-linux org>)

     • Polish translation of manual page (Tomasz Pala <gotar att pld-linux
       org>)

       prioritized in order they are appear in config file.

     • bugfix: -s URL works fine

     • new "--ignore" option makes packages invisible to the poldek

     • "hdrl" sources can be refreshed with --upa

     • fixed package removal: don't follow dependencies if only one of
       multiple-installed packages is intended to uninstall

     • shell: search: pattern is treated as shell wildcard (matched by
       fnmatch(3)) by default; previous behavior (Perl regular expression
       matching) is available with --perlre or "rsearch" alias.

     • fixed package auto-selection among equivalents: dependencies aren't
       verified strictly during package scoring.

     • fixed bug of equivalent package selection (<Enter> was select first,

0.17.3 (major enhancements release; 2002/04/23)

     • supported "hdlist" files (simple raw RPM package headers list) as
       sources. These files are used by APT-RPM as they are widely supported
       by RPM based distributions. However this format isn't optimal, now
       poldek is useable with almost every RPM based distro without poldek's
       native indexes support. See poldekrc.sample-{rh,mdk} for examples of
       RedHat and Mandrake configuration.

       inconfiguration file. Needed to distinguish "hdlist" ('hdrl' type)
       from"native" index format. Cmdline options: --source for 'pidx',
       --sdir for'dir' and --shdrl for 'hdrl'.

     • support for GPG/PGP signatures verification (new "gpg" and "pgp"
       source options). Verification works well with rpm >= 4.0.4 or patched
       PLD's rpm 4.0.2 package (release 62).

     • simple HTTP client (with partly HTTP/1.1 support), it is used for HTTP
       downloads; cURL backend is not compiled by default.

     • added IPv6 support to internal FTP client

     • new "--clean" and "--clean-whole" options for cache directorycleanup

     • URLs with user and password (ftp://user:passwd at host:port/path/
       syntax) are supported (Andreas Piesk <a.piesk att gmx net>)

     • new "ftp_sysuser_as_anon_passwd" option causes sending login at
       hostname as anonymous FTP password

     • new "noautoup" source option tells poldek to do not update source by
       default.

     • misc fixes to compile on SuSE

     • fixed rpm 3.x support (with help of Roger Luethi <rl att hellgate ch>)

       on/off and enable/disable to the list of valid choices (Andreas Piesk
       <a.piesk att gmx net>)

     • packages with capabilities with the same name and different versions
       are handled properly

       Piesk <a.piesk att gmx net>)

     • installation of multiple instances of package is allowed (by poldek
       -i)

     • fixes and improvements of dependency resolution

     • German translation (Andreas Piesk <a.piesk att gmx net>)

     • various bugs are fixed

     • corrected package installation progress bar (Michal Moskal <malekith
       att pld-linux org>)

     • install-dist: log INST-{OK,ERR} for PLD Installer (Michal Moskal
       <malekith att pld-linux org>)
