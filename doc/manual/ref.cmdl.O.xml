<para>
Can be used to give options in the format used in the configuration file.  
This is useful  for  specifying  options  for  which there is no separate 
command-line flag. Whitespaces in option names may be replaced 
with underscore '_' or dash '-' there, for example:
<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt> <command>poldek</command> -O keep-downloads=yes
</screen>
