/** @mainpage 
This is a sort of poor C programmer's Log4J. It lacks many features. But, in
true C-hacker spirit, it is even more efficient. This is critical, since I plan
to use it in some real-time, embedded software.

All the documentation is in log4c.h.

Take a look at test_log4c.c for a short usage example.
