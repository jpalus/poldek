1) Source repositries related

New "source" options: --stl, --st, --mkidx-type  (see --help)

* new repository index format ('pndir') with package descriptions
  moved to separate file(s). Based on tndb (cdb like) DBM library.
  This is the *default* format. 

* APT repositories ("hdrl" alias "apt" type) are updateable now. 

* support for Yum repositries ("yum" type)

* if --up fails with "desynchronized index" then --upa is performed 
  by default 

* --mkidxz is depreciated - created indexes are compressed by default

* with option --mkidx-type=TYPE[,TYPE] type(s) of created indexe(s)
  may be set, it is possible to create index in many formats at once

* with --nodiff index's diffs are not created

* creation of native indexes (pdir, pndir) are much faster -- package
  headers are not loaded at all if package's file modification time
  is the same as saved in existing index.

2) Installation related

* poldek can perform 'to repository' installation, i.e packages
  are copied from source to destination repository with full
  dependency checking, ex:

  $ poldek -n ...  --install-dest /var/foo/rpms-repo --upgrade-dist
