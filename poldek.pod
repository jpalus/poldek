=head1 NAME

poldek - rpm packages management helper tool

=head1 SYNOPSIS

poldek [--source=SOURCE] [OPTION...] [PACKAGE...]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

poldek is a cmdline tool which can be used to verify, install and
upgrade given package sets. It was inspired by L<apt_get(8)> tool
from Debian's APT.

In general poldek gets packages information from special package index
file (called I<Packages>) and performs one of the following actions:

=over

=item * Build package index

=item * Update package index

=item * Verify package set

=item * Install system from scratch

=item * Upgrade whole system

=item * Install or upgrade custom packages 

=back

Packages and indexes can be retrieved from remote servers by poldek
itself (by simple FTP and HTTP clients from rpmlib) or by external
downloaders (not configured by default, see L</CONFIG FILE> for
details). Currently four types of URLs are supported: FTP, HTTP, 
HTTPS and RSYNC.

=head1 SPECIFING SOURCE

The source is specified by B<--source> option:

B<--source,--stxt,--sdir,-s> B<SOURCE>

where SOURCE can be a local path or URL.

Examples:

=over

=item $ poldek -s /dir/with/RPMS/ [OPTION...]

=item $ poldek -s /dir/with/RPMS/Package.gz [OPTION...]

=item $ poldek -s ftp://ftp.ala.ma.kota/RPMS/Packages.gz

=item $ poldek -s rsync://rsync.ala-ma-kota.com/RPMS/Packages.gz

=back

If you want to build Packages, then only directory
path as SOURCE is accepted.

If Packages and packages are stored in diffrent
locations then option:

B<-P, --prefix> B<PREFIX>

could be used to point packages one, e.g.:

$ poldek -s /tmp/Packages.gz --prefix=/cdrom/RPMS/

Another parameter is B<--cachedir=DIR>, which points to
directory where fetched packages and indexes are 
store (default is /tmp).

=head1 SPECIFING PACKAGES

Packages could be specified in three ways:

=over

=item * as packages files in arguments:

$ poldek ...  ala-ma-kota-2.1-2.i386.rpm

=item * as packages names with:

B<-n, --pkgnevr="NAME [[E:][V[-R]]]">

for example:

$ poldek ... -n "apache 1.3.12" -n gzip 

$ poldek ... -n "Bezdany 1:908.9-26" -n ziptool

=item * as package sets taken from pkgset files B<-p, --pkgset=FILE>,
(see README.package-sets):

$ poldek ... -p ../package-sets/tiny-system

=back

All above options could be combined.


=head1 BASIC MODES

One of the following basic modes must be selected:

=over 4

=item B<--mkidx[z][=FILE]>  

Build package index, by default it's stored in SOURCE/Packages.[gz].
I<NOTE>: SOURCE must be directory.

=item B<--update>    

Resynchronize the package index from its source.
It is necessary only for remote Packages and it 
should be the first operation before program usage. 

=item B<-V|--verify>

This option checks dependenecies and conflicts of package set.
Without packages specified it checks all packages.

=item B<--intall-dist[=DIR]>

Install system from scratch under DIR as root directory (/).
Needs packages to be specified.

=item B<--upgrade-dist[=DIR]>

Install the newest versions of all packages currently installed 
on the system from the specified source (see L</SOURCE>).

=item B<-i, --install|-U, --upgrade>

Install or upgrade given packages.

=back 

=head2 Options for install modes

=over

=item B<--dump[=FILE]> just dump packages FQPNs to FILE or stdout instead 
of install them.

=item B<--fetch=DIR> like B<--dump> but packages are downloaded.

=item B<--rpmdef="NAME VALUE"> like rpm's --define option.
=item B<--nodeps>; B<-t, --test>; B<--justdb>; B<--force> have the 
same meanings like RPM ones. See next section.



=head1 COOPERATING WITH RPM

Currently all installations except B<install-dist> are made
by RPM, which is executed in background. Options passed to rpm:

=over

=item * --force 

=item * --install

=item * --justdb

=item * --nodeps

=item * --test

=item * --upgrade 

=item * --rpmdef (passed as --define)

=back

=head2


Other rpm options may be passed as arguments like B<--rpm-RPM_LONG_OPTION>,
e.g:

$ poldek ... -- --rpm-noscripts --rpm-notriggers


=head1 CONFIG FILE

Program tries to read configuration from F<$HOME/.poldekrc>
by default, B<-c,--conf> option could points to other location.
With B<-z, --noconf> poldek don't read any config. 

Config file consists of parameters of the form

'name = value'

The file is line-based - that is, each newline-terminated
line represents a comment or a parameter.

=head2 Parameters:

=over

=item * B<source>

=item * B<prefix>

=item * B<cachedir>

=back

=head1

Downloaders are configured by B<PROTOCOL_get="SPEC"> parameter.  The
SPEC is a command formated string, where at least 2 semi-macros of 4
available should be used:

=over 

=item B<%p[n]> - package basename (FQPN)

=item B<%P[n]> - package full path

=item B<%d> - cache directory

=item B<%D> - cache directory/package basename

=back

=head1

Currently three protocols are available: FTP, HTTP and RSYNC.  Special
B<ftp_http> "protocol" could be used for describe downloader for both
HTTP and FTP; by default wget is used as FTP/HTTP downloader.

Examples:

ftp_http_get   = "/usr/bin/wget -N --dot-style=binary -P %d %Pn"

ftp_get        = "/usr/bin/curl %P -o %D"

ftp_get        = "/usr/bin/snarf %P %D"

rsync_get      = "/usr/bin/rsync -v %P %d"

See also sample configs included in distribution.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Packages creation

$ poldek -s /cdrom/PLD/RPMS/ --mkidx=/tmp/dummy.txt

$ poldek -s /ftp/pub/PLD/RPMS/ --mkidxz

=head2 Verification

$ poldek -s rsync://ala.ma.kota/PLD/RPMS/Packages.gz -V

$ poldek -s /dir/with/RPMS/Packages.gz -V -n "apache"

=head2 Installation from scratch

$ poldek -s ftp://ftp.trurl.net/PLD/RPMS/Packages.gz 
  --install-dist=/mnt/dest -p ftp://home.net/my-pkgsets/myset

Above command installs a "myset" package subset under 
/mnt/dest as root. 

I<NOTE>: mounted ROOT/proc is propably needed for 
some package postinstall scripts.  

=head2 Upgrade whole system:

$ poldek -s ftp://ftp.tatry.pl/PLD/RPMS/Packages --upgrade-dist

Only fetch packages marked for upgrade:

$ poldek -s ftp://ftp.rankiem.net.pl/PLD/RPMS/Packages 
  --upgrade-dist --fetch=/tmp/PLD-up/

Dump packages FQPNs marked for upgrade:

$ poldek -s ftp://ftp.pld.org.pl/PLD/RPMS/Packages 
 --upgrade-dist --dump=/tmp/PLD-up-`date +%Y.%m.%d-%H.%M`

Test only:

$ poldek -s ftp://ftp.pociemku.org/PLD/RPMS/Packages 
  --upgrade-dist --test


=head2 Install/upgrade custom packages:

$ poldek -s ftp://ftp.znienacka.com/PLD/RPMS/Packages.gz 
-U -n apache -n "ala-ma-kota 1.2" smail-12-389.i386.rpm

$ poldek -s ftp://ftp.dudy.net/RPMS/Packages.gz -ti -n xteddy

=head1 ENVIROMENT

$HOME is used to read config file.
  
=head1 BUGS

=head2 File conflicts

Conflicts are detected by comparision files sizes and modes only,
which means that not all conflicts may be detected because files MD5
sums are not compared (including they will increase memory consumption
over 100.000 * 16 bytes).

=head2 Upgrade and "Obsoletes" RPM tag

In PLD I<http://www.pld.org.pl>, which is primary developement
platform for poldek, Obsoletes tag is used in two diffrent meanings:
the first means B<A> I<obsoletes> B<B>, the second means B<A> I<is
equivalent of> B<B>. Obviously it makes impossible to distinguish them
and use during upgrades (in Red Hat Linux only the first mean is used,
so Red Hat Installer use this tag).

=head2 Upgrade and more than one instance of the package

AFAIK rpm 3.x doesn't handle this case (4.x introduces special 
tag RPMTAG_MULTILIB for these cases, I suppose), so poldek
does not handle it also.  

=head2 Documentation

This manual should be finished and translated into English.
