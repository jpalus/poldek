    <sect> Intro
    <p>

    The poldek is a RPM packages management helper tool; its
    basic features are similar to any modern package updater like <em>apt-get</em>.

    Program takes information about packages from custom package index file
    (called <em>package.dir.gz</em> by default), and allows to package 
    install, upgrade and removal. 
    Package dependencies are automatically handled, so if you try to install 
    a package that needs others to be installed, it will download all
    needed packages and install them. 

    Program supports various sources of packages: filesystem, removable media 
    (like CDROM), FTP, HTTP(S), RSYNC.
 
    The main poldek's advantages are:
    <itemize>

    <item> Relatively fast dependencies processing
    <p>
    Package dependencies, conflicts and ordering are handled by poldek
    itself, without rpmlib usage, so program is significatly faster and uses
    less memory than rpmlib-based tools.


    <item> Smart install or upgrade of a big package sets 
    <p> 
    Before packages installation they are divided into small groups,
    usually 2 - 10 items (depends on their reciprocal dependencies).
    Each group is installed separately in the manner that ensures 
    that broken packages dependencies in one of group doesn't affect 
    the rest i.e. it is allowed to upgrade as many as possible packages. 

    Another profit is that upgrade/install huge set of packages (e.g. upgrade 
    whole system) needs less memory and disk space (if packages need 
    to be downloaded).
   
    <item> Interactive mode 
    <p>
    Except a batch mode (similar to <em>apt-get</em> one) poldek has   
    <em>interactive</em> mode, which puts the user into a readline 
    interface with command line autocompletion and history. 
    In this mode user is able to browse, search, download, install/upgrade and 
    uninstall packages. This is similar in concept to shell mode of Perl's CPAN module
    (see sample <url name="interactive mode session" 
              url="screenshoots.html#shell-session">).

    <item> Installation system from scratch needs 8-12 MB memory only
    <p>	
    During this type of install packages are downloaded and installed separately, 
    so used memory size is independent of number of packages intended
    to install. Program is used by <url name="PLD Installer" 
    url="http://team.pld.org.pl/~klakier/doc/pld-installer/en/index.html">
    

    <item> Quick package set verification for unresolved dependencies 
    unneeded conflicts and dependency loops. <p>
    Feature is is useful for distribution maintainers; see sample
    <url name="report" url="screenshoots.html#verify-report">).

    <item> Division package set for the purpose of placing it
      on removable media (like CDROM or ZIP).
    <p>

    Program divide packages in the way that minimize needs of  
    disk changes; for example if distribution fits on 3 CDs, then 
    only 2 changes of CD disk are necessary during installation system 
    from scratch.
    This feature is used for making PLD CD ISO images, see 
    <url name="geniso-poldek" 
    url="ftp://ftp.pld.org.pl/.stat/geniso-poldek"> 
    script for details. 


    <item> Support for "patches" of package index 
    <p>
    To save users time and bandwidth program supports "incremental indexes"
    which is very useful with repositories which frequently changed (PLD package 
    repository is changed few times a week). This feature consist in 
    creation "patches" of index which gives the users possibilty to update 
    his local index by download "patch" with information on changes only.

    <item> Program is prepared to be run by ordinary user, installation 
    of packages in that case can be done with <em>sudo</em>. 

    </itemize>

    <sect> Quick start 
    <p>
    <sect1> Prepare package repository to be usable to poldek
    <p>
    <tscreen><verb>
    $ poldek -s DIR --mkidxz
    </verb></tscreen>

    As result several files will be created under DIR: 
    <itemize>
    <item> <em>packages.dir.gz</em>  with all needed package data 
    <item> <em>packages.dir.mdd </em> with packages.dir.gz's digest
    <item> <em>packages.dir.toc.gz </em> with list of packages 
    </itemize>

    Additionally if previous <em>DIR/packages.dir.gz</em> is different from 
    currently created one then index "patch" is created under <em>DIR/packages.i/</em>
  
    Example:
    <tscreen><verb>
 $ poldek -s /home/ftp/pub/PLD/RPMS --mkidxz
 Loading /home/ftp/pub/PLD/RPMS/...200..400..600..800..1000..1200..1400..1600

    <sect1> Use the program 
    <p>
    <tscreen><verb>
    $ poldek -s SOURCE [OPTION...] [PACKAGE...]
