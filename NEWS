0.17.3 (not released yet)

* added simple HTTP client which it is used for HTTP downloads by default;
  cURL backend is not compiled by default.

* support for GPG/PGP signatures verification (new "gpg" and "pgp" 
  source options)

* vftp: URLs with user and password (ftp://user:passwd@host:port/path/ syntax) 
  are supported (Andreas Piesk <a.piesk@gmx.net>)

* vftp: new "ftp_sysuser_as_anon_passwd" option causes sending 
  login@hostname as anonymous FTP password 

* new "noautoup" source option

* shell: added long listig format of file list ($ desc -ll)

* misc fixes to compile on SuSE

0.17.2
* "ported" to RedHat 7.2 (with rpm 4.0.4)
* install-dist: --force forces installation of broken package sets
* corrected package installation progress bar 
	(Michal Moskal <malekith@pld.org.pl>)
* install-dist: log INST-{OK,ERR} for PLD Installer
	(Michal Moskal <malekith@pld.org.pl>)
* --dump* works properly
* vftp: fixed error handling


0.17.1
* ftp: fixed multiline responses handling

0.17 (beta release):
* added support for package.dir's "patches" (new option --update-whole
  updates whole index; --update looking for patches first)

* packages are divided into groups before install and each group 
  is installed separately; this ensures that broken dependencies in 
  one of group doesn't affect the rest. 

* improved dependency processing:
  - package may be marked for install as a consequence of conflict

  - dependency loops detected during install time are noticed in human 
    readable form

  - improved "greedy" selection - if foo-VER is upgraded, then eventual 
    "greedy" marks will mark foo-{devel,static,etc} in version VER too.

* added simple ftp client; it is used for FTP downloads by default

* shell: 
  - db package list is cached what speeds up program start
  - ls: long listings are passed to $PAGER program (default is "less")
  - ls: new switches: -n (list package names only), -G (list group)
        and -O (show package summaries)

* added log file support (--log option)

* sources may be configured as name and URL pair and later 
  selected by that name (new --sn|-n option). 
  With --sl|-l program lists all configured sources.
  
* packages.dir's integrity is verified before each loading
  what prevents program SIGSEVs on load broken indexes

* changed default cache directory to $HOME/.poldek-cache

* package MD5 sums are verified before install

* with --ask program confirms each installation (confirm_install config 
  option) and allows the user to choose among equivalent packages 
  (choose_equivalents_manually config option)
 
* few (nice) improvements and (not so nice ;-) bugs fixed
