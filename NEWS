0.19.0 (major enhancements release; not released yet)

* new package index format ('pndir') with descriptions
  of packages moved to separate file. 
* dependency removed   


0.18.1 (major bugfix release; 2002/11/27)

* ability of creation empty indexes
* killed SIGSEV on '$ poldek -s /' (#443)
* fixed presentation of dependency tree during unistallations; information 
  about what package marks an others was completely broken 
* killed SIGSEV during dependencies processing
* fixed vfile's progress bar 
* fixed 'hold' and 'ignore' package patterns matching
* fixed bug of interactive mode; after interrupted installation
  selected packages are properly unmarked now. 


0.18 (bugfix/minor enhancements release; 2002/11/07)

* support for RPM 4.1 (with help of Artur Frysiak <wiget@pld.org.pl>)

* few dependency processing improvements:
  - greedy upgrades are performed instead of marking different versions 
    of the same package,
  - with --greedy packages are selected by Obsoletes tag too.

* 'hold' and 'ignore' package masks are matched with source name, package epoch, 
   version and release, i.e. masks apache-1.3.2* or ra:apache-1* are valid ones now. 

* new: with --unique-pkg-names (-Q) packages with the same name are removed from 
  available package set

* sources are prioritized in order they are passed in cmdline, i.e. with 
  $ poldek -s /foo/bar -n pld 

  source 'foo/bar' obtains highest priority than 'pld', no matter
  what priority 'pld' has in config file. 

* fixed available package list management in interactive mode 

* AM/AC stuff cleanup and adaptation to their new versions (automake 1.7 and autoconf 2.54)
  (Artur Frysiak <wiget@pld.org.pl>)

* Polish translation of manual page (GoTaR <gotar@pld.org.pl>)

* fix: progress bar isn't refreshed so frequently (#367)


0.17.9 (bugfix/minor enhancements release; 2002/09/20)

* Obsoletes tag is used during upgrades (if --greedy is set)
* fixed dependency EVR matching
* source priorities (new 'pri' source option) -- if the same package is available
  in more than one source than program takes package from source with highest priority.
  If priorities aren't set sources are prioritized in order they are appear in config file.
* bugfix: -s URL works fine 


0.17.8 (major bugfix release; 2002/08/18)

* package installation is verified with rpm database if rpm reports failure
* fixed obsoletes matching (Jakub Bogusz <qboosh@pld.org.pl>)
* improved and fixed file based conflicts detection
* fixed size units display (GoTaR <gotar@poczta.onet.pl>)


0.17.7 (bugfix release; 2002/06/14)

* improved package conflicts resolving
* split: SIGSEV killed 
* fixed package removal  
* shell: search: fixed default options processing

0.17.6 (minor bugfix release; 2002/06/03)

* new "--ignore" option makes packages invisible to the poldek 
* "hdrl" sources can be refreshed with --upa 
* fixed package removal: don't follow dependencies if only one of 
  multiple-installed packages is intended to uninstall 
* shell: search: pattern is treated as shell wildcard (matched by fnmatch(3)) 
  by default; previous behavior (Perl regular expression matching) is available
  with --perlre or "rsearch" alias. 
* fixed package auto-selection among equivalents: dependencies aren't 
  verified strictly during package scoring. 
* fixed bug of equivalent package selection (<Enter> was select first, not
  default package).
* shell: with 'upgrade' and 'greedy-upgrade' commands only upgradeable 
  packages are auto-completed.  


0.17.5 (minor bugfix release; 2002/05/15)

* about 75% less memory is used by incremental update of packages.dir 
* improved package auto-selection among equivalents: package which marks
  less packages to install is preferred
* vftp: fixed logging in when server doesn't ask for password 
  (Przemyslaw Frasunek <venglin@freebsd.lublin.pl>)
* bugfix: root directory (--rootdir) is always passed to rpm as absolute path  
* shell: desc: file mode is displayed in human readable form
* fixed vfjuggle: packages.dir.md* are copied to hdd too
* few SIGSEVs killed on "search" command when APT's pkglist file 
  is used as package index (thanks to Gustavo Niemeyer <niemeyer@conectiva.com>)


0.17.4 (bugfix/minor enhancements release; 2002/05/06)

* new (major) modes:
   --downgrade downgrade given packages
   --reinstall major mode reinstalls given packages
   -e,--erase removes packages with its reverse dependent ones

* shell: fixed C-c handling (connecting phase can be interrupted)
* improved splitting: 
  - packages are auto-rearranged on chunk's boundaries 
  - masks with priority < 0 are always applied at first
* killed SIGSEV on long URL's basenames
* source prefix is handled properly with --mkidx*

0.17.3

* supported "hdlist" files (simple raw RPM package headers list) as 
  sources. These files are used by APT-RPM as they are widely supported 
  by RPM based distributions. However this format isn't optimal, now 
  poldek is useable with almost every RPM based distro without poldek's 
  native indexes support.
	
  See poldekrc.sample-{rh,mdk} for examples of RedHat and Mandrake 
  configuration.

* new "type=[pidx|dir|hdrl]" source option lets define source type in
  configuration file. Needed to distinguish "hdlist" ('hdrl' type) from
  "native" index format. Cmdline options: --source for 'pidx', --sdir for
  'dir' and  --shdrl for 'hdrl'.

* support for GPG/PGP signatures verification (new "gpg" and "pgp" 
  source options). Verification works well with rpm >= 4.0.4 or patched 
  PLD's rpm 4.0.2 package (release 62). 

* simple HTTP client (with partly HTTP/1.1 support), it is used for 
  HTTP downloads; cURL backend is not compiled by default. 

* added IPv6 support to internal FTP client

* new "--clean" and "--clean-whole" options for cache directory
  cleanup

* URLs with user and password (ftp://user:passwd@host:port/path/ syntax) 
  are supported (Andreas Piesk <a.piesk@gmx.net>)

* new "ftp_sysuser_as_anon_passwd" option causes sending 
  login@hostname as anonymous FTP password 

* new "noautoup" source option tells poldek to do not update 
  source by default. 

* shell: added long listig format of file list (poldek> desc -ll)

* misc fixes to compile on SuSE

* fixed rpm 3.x support (with help of Roger Luethi <rl@hellgate.ch>)

* fixed and improved handling of bool configuration options, 
  added on/off and enable/disable to the list of valid choices
  (Andreas Piesk <a.piesk@gmx.net>)

* fixed detection of file based conflicts between available packages. 

* packages with capabilities with the same name and different
  versions are handled properly

* misc fixes to compile and work with glibc2.1 (with 
  help of Andreas Piesk <a.piesk@gmx.net>) 

* installation of multiple instances of package is allowed (by poldek -i)

* fixes and improvements of dependency resolution:
  - fixed greedy mode  
  - fixed handling package conflicts added by poldek  
  - faster dependency checking

* German translation (Andreas Piesk <a.piesk@gmx.net>)

* various bugs are fixed:
   - double '/' in paths handling
   - huge mem leak on --update 
   - ambiguous p_open() flags (Michal Moskal <malekith@pld.org.pl>)
   - removed [v]snprintf() (wrong) usage; trurlib's n_[v]snprintf() 
     are used instead
   - automake/autoconf fixes (Artur Frysiak <wiget@pld.org.pl>)
   - many minor fixes (thanks to Andreas Piesk <a.piesk@gmx.net>)

0.17.2
* "ported" to RedHat 7.2 (with rpm 4.0.4)
* install-dist: --force forces installation of broken package sets
* corrected package installation progress bar 
	(Michal Moskal <malekith@pld.org.pl>)
* install-dist: log INST-{OK,ERR} for PLD Installer
	(Michal Moskal <malekith@pld.org.pl>)
* --dump* works properly
* vftp: fixed error handling


0.17.1
* ftp: fixed multiline responses handling

0.17 (beta release):
* added support for package.dir's "patches" (new option --update-whole
  updates whole index; --update looking for patches first)

* packages are divided into groups before install and each group 
  is installed separately; this ensures that broken dependencies in 
  one of group doesn't affect the rest. 

* improved dependency processing:
  - package may be marked for install as a consequence of conflict

  - dependency loops detected during install time are noticed in human 
    readable form

  - improved "greedy" selection - if foo-VER is upgraded, then eventual 
    "greedy" marks will mark foo-{devel,static,etc} in version VER too.

* added simple ftp client; it is used for FTP downloads by default

* shell: 
  - db package list is cached what speeds up program start
  - ls: long listings are passed to $PAGER program (default is "less")
  - ls: new switches: -n (list package names only), -G (list group)
        and -O (show package summaries)

* added log file support (--log option)

* sources may be configured as name and URL pair and later 
  selected by that name (new --sn|-n option). 
  With --sl|-l program lists all configured sources.
  
* packages.dir's integrity is verified before each loading
  what prevents program SIGSEVs on load broken indexes

* changed default cache directory to $HOME/.poldek-cache

* package MD5 sums are verified before install

* with --ask program confirms each installation (confirm_install config 
  option) and allows the user to choose among equivalent packages 
  (choose_equivalents_manually config option)
 
* few (nice) improvements and (not so nice ;-) bugs fixed
