- vhttp: support for HTTP redirects and auth
- don't load full file list from db if "depdirs"
  is loaded from local db.

* mis 2002/03/14
- more compact install_summary()
- modify rpmlib API to allow to read rpmdb indexes 
  without reading headers data. Needed to replace dbopen() usage
  in rpm_get_dbdepdirs()

* mis 2001/05/18
- unistalled packages should be ordered using uninst prerequirements 
- detection of fatal rpmlib errors during install-dist


* mis  2000/09/20
- patch wget, rsync and snarf to support syntax like:
  $ downloader --destdir=DIR --prefix=URLPREFIX [BASENAME...]
  
  Currently, except wget, no one support that, which forces poldek to 
  execute downloader for every file. Wget doesn't support --prefix
  like option, which makes cmdline longer than can be.   

Long term:
- Use external db for file list storage (custom binary format? modified cdb?). 
  Currently PLD distribution (about 2400 packages) contains about 110.000 
  files.
