- libcurl's backed for vfile

* mis  2000/09/20
- interactive mode (see README.package-sets)

- check packages MD5 sums and PGP signatures

- support packages user level information (Summaries, Descriptions, etc).
  It should be placed in a separate index file (IMO format used by dictd
  (<http://www.dict.org>) is suitable for this purpose)

- easy to use libpoldek API for external programs.

- patch wget, rsync and snarf to support syntax like:
  $ downloader --destdir=DIR --prefix=URLPREFIX [BASENAME...]
  
  Currently, except wget, no one support that, which forces poldek to 
  execute downloader for every file. Wget doesn't support --prefix
  like option, which makes cmdline longer than can be.   

- patch wget and snarf to use non-standard, but widely supported 
  MDTM ftp command for timestamping. Currently only wget supports 
  timestamping but fetches file list for every file. 

- write as small as possible an unrpm tool for unpacking given files from
  rpm package (use tools/*.c from rpm sources and cpio*.c from pldilib 
  sources). 
  It will be used on bootdisks for extract poldek.static from fetched 
  say, "install-suite" rpm package.


Long term:
- Use external db for file list storage (custom binary format? modified cdb?). 
  Currently PLD distribution (about 1800 packages) contains about 110.000 
  files.

- Do a complete check (dependencies and conflicts) during upgrade/install.
  It will make possible to use rpm only for install package (now is done 
  only for install-dist, where is no installed packages)
