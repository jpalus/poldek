- unistalled packages should be ordered using uninst prerequirements 
- listing of packages contents
- detection of fatal rpmlib errors during install-dist

* mis  2000/09/20
- check packages MD5 sums and PGP signatures

- patch wget, rsync and snarf to support syntax like:
  $ downloader --destdir=DIR --prefix=URLPREFIX [BASENAME...]
  
  Currently, except wget, no one support that, which forces poldek to 
  execute downloader for every file. Wget doesn't support --prefix
  like option, which makes cmdline longer than can be.   

- patch wget and snarf to use non-standard, but widely supported 
  MDTM ftp command for timestamping. Currently only wget supports 
  timestamping but fetches file list for every file. 

Long term:
- Use external db for file list storage (custom binary format? modified cdb?). 
  Currently PLD distribution (about 2400 packages) contains about 110.000 
  files.
